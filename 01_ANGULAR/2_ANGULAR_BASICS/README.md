# ANGULAR BASICS - First Application (TODO List)

## Setup Requirements

* Go here and prepare your setups. [Install Angular](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart)
* Check `ng` command is working on you command prompt.
* You are ready !!!

## First Angular App

* Go to directory where you want to create your new project.
* On CMD/terminal type `ng new <yourprojectname>`. It will take sometime to setup all the requirements.
* On completion move inside the project folder i.e. `<yourprojectname>` and enter command `npm start` to start the project.
* By default, Angular app will open on `localhost:4200`

## Angular Concepts

* File Structure of Module and Components.

`Module` - this is the top level structure in which you import other modules. Generally you can find a file called `app.module.ts` which will contain the module. This contains `root` component and other normal component `declarations`.

* Component Decorators

`Component` - this is basic buidling block of an application.

Components can be generated via generate command :

```javascript
  ng generate component list
```

This above command will generate the list component.
A component is represented by `@Component` decorator which will be inside `.ts` file of a component generated. This will look like:

```javascript
@Component({
  selector: 'list',
  templateUrl: './list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./list.component.css']
})
```

`selector` - this is the way component will be called in HTML files. e.g. `<list></list>`
`templateUrl` - location of HTML of this component
`styleUrls` - location of CSS files which are applied on this component. You can apply multiple CSS files.

* Interpolation / Data Binding

`{{name}}` - Interpolation brackets are used to denote that name is a variable in Angular Class and is not be used as HTML string.

`[ngClass]="className"` - Single way data-binding.It means `className` is a variable not a string.

`[(ngModel)]="text"` - Two way data-binding.It means `className` is a variable not a string and ngModel will change `text` value on each event of Change in Input.

* Event Binding

 `click` - This is one of event which can be used in Angular. Any event can be put on any element of html.

 ```javascript
 <button (click)="add()">Add Item</button>
 ```

 In above example, button has an `click` event and it will call a `add` function on click.

### Syntax and Usage of Directives

#### ngModel

`ngModel` - To use this you have to import `FormsModule` to `app.module.ts`. you will have to use `import` in module file.

```javascript
 import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
```

```javascript
  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="newTask">
```

This will 2-way bind input box to a variable `newTask`.

#### ngFor

`ngFor` - To use this you will need an array or collection on which you can iterate.

```javascript
<li *ngFor="let task of tasks">
```

This will create multiple elements of type `li` or any tag which has `ngFor`.

#### ngClass

`ngClass` - This will help you in applying a `class` attribute on any html tag - based on a condition.

```javascript
 <li [ngClass]="{'green':name =='sachin'}"></li>
 ```

 The above example shows that list item will have `green` class applied - only if `name` variable has value `"sachin"`

 You can also apply multiple class condition at once.

```javascript
 <li [ngClass]="{'green':name =='sachin', 'red':name== 'virat'"></li>
 ```

 The above example shows that list item will have `green` class applied - only if `name` variable has value `"sachin"` and will have `red` class applied - only if `name` variable has value `"virat"`

#### ngIf

 `ngIf` - This is a conditional operator which lets you control when a element is created or not

 ```javascript
 <li *ngIf ="name =='sachin'"></li>
 ```

#### ngStyle

`ngStyle` - This will help you in applying a inline-css style via `style` attribute on any html tag - based on a condition.

You can also apply multiple class condition at once.

```javascript
 <li [ngStyle]="{'background-color':color;}"></li>
 ```

 The above example shows that list item will have background color which is defined in `color` variable. Please take care that `color` is a variable here and not a `string`. So if `color` has value `"blue"` - background becomes blue.

## Assignment 5

Create a complete Todo List web application which can manage your daily tasks. These are the feature required in list.

* You can add new tasks to list.
* You can remove a task from the list by delete button.
* You can edit a task from your list and change its "text".
* You can change status of task to `done` or `pending`. This can be done using list item colors. You can click on a task to change its status.
* You should show at top of list : Number of total task in List and Number of Pending Tasks i.e. Tasks - (3/10). Which means 3 tasks are pending out of total 10 tasks.
* You can give an entry and exit animation to each list item using `animate.css`.
* You can optional use bootstrap classes for improving the overall UI/UX
* Add a `createdAt` time to each list item object - and list should show the date a item was created at.
* Add a priority to be added to each item like - High, Medium, Low - You can show priority by background colors - Dark green : High priority, Normal green : Medium Priority, Light green - Low priority. You can use a dropdown to assign priorty while adding a new task.

## Assignment 6

Take Game of flags code and improve functionalities of game with :

* Add multiple choice buttons instead of input text.
* Improve UI using bootstrap
* Create a scoring mechansim for 'right' answers. Scoring should also reward continuous correct answers.
* Improve application by adding common features like - auto start, reset button etc.
* You can also add sound/gifs on correct and wrong.


## Mini Project 2

### Converting Photogram,Bloggr,Twtr,EShoppie to Angular Project

1. Pick your `tabler-dev` theme. Don't use the `jQuery` version of assignment. Use the fresh theme package zip.
2. You have to create the same kind of application as in Assignment 4. Only difference being code should be done in Angular 6. You will have to divide the theme in components like "header", "footer", "content", "cards" etc.
3. Use a JSON array to represent all your cards in your project. A `*ngFor` will create cards according to data. No static card will be there if your array is empty.
4. You will have to create a form to enter all info of a new card. Don't use `prompt` now.
5. All CSS files can be used in global `index.html` or `angular.json` file to have proper linking.

** 6,7,8 points will be discussed in Monday class you can work on other points for now.

6. All pages `login`, `signup`, `form` will be separate components.
7. All pages will be linked via `Routing`.
8. Data of JSON format will be stored under `Services` which can share data between components.
