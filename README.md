## How to host your project

* Create a Repository with name `<yourusername>.github.io` where `<yourusername>` is your github username.
* Go to your project which you want to host. Make main file as `index.html` this file will open first on your hosted site.
* Use standard git commands - to add, commit, push all file to this remote repository.
* Finally you can open a URL like `<yourusername>.github.io` and you will see your project 'LIVE' !!

Note : Other studens can check their marks individually from mentors. Overall results show that lack of practise is visible and few of you have to spend more time in labs and extra classes. Mentors are available full day on `Mon-Fri` and Partially on `Saturday/Sunday`.

Batch 1 has slighlty better performance than Batch 2 overall (Given that coding round of Batch 2 was easier than that of Batch 1)
